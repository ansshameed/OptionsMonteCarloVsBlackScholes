# OptionsPricingMCBS
Understanding options pricing by comparing results between the Monte Carlo Simulation and Black Scholes. 


- Dynamic functionality to adjust options parameters (e.g. volatility, no. simulations, time steps etc.) to change options price. 
- GUI to see comparability between Monte Carlo and Black Scholes options pricing by visualising graphs. 
- Visualisation of random walks of asset prices using Brownian Motion.
